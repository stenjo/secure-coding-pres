# Antifragile
## Things that Gain from Disorder
By Nassim Nicholas Taleb
![Taleb](/images/nassim-nicholas-taleb-1221.jpg) {width=200px margin=30px align=right}

Pocket 2013 English

The antifragile is beyond the resilient or robust. The resil­ient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better.
Just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension, many things in life benefit from stress, disorder, volatility, and turmoil. What Taleb has identified and calls antifragile are things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish.

# Antifragile applications

!['Fragile vs Antifragile'](/images/Fragile_Antifragile.png) { w-full h-auto }

::right::


## Antifragile:
- performance increases under increasing stres

## Robust:
- performance constant under increasing stress

## Fragile:
- performance reduces under stress

<!--
Antifragility is when the system becomes stronger when more stress is applied. Our own body is an antifragile system. When we train, we actually are damaging the muscle cells a little, an our body rebuilds them but just a little stronger than they were.

For an application or an IT system, stress is user load, unusual ways of using the application, hacking attempts, changing package versions and all the other stuff that might contribute to the system breaking down

The 'healing' process is the routines, the practices, the speed and the general mindset in changing the system.

# Secure by Design
by Dan Johnsson, Daniel Sawano, Daniel Deogun

Pocket 2019 English

Summary

Secure by Design teaches developers how to use design to drive security in software development. This book is full of patterns, best practices, and mindsets that you can directly apply to your real world development. You''ll also learn to spot weaknesses in legacy code and how to address them.

<!--

Inspired by this book we decided to go for Domain Primitives as part of our secure architecture when building our next application

# Sanitizing input

## First line defence
```html
<input type="email" required pattern="^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$" />
```

## Restrict input format

```ts
const sanitizeInput = (value: string) => {
  return value.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]/g, ""); // Remove special characters
};
```

## Strong form types

```ts
interface FormData {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}

const [formData, setFormData] = useState<FormData>({ name: "", email: "", age: 0 });
```

<!--
Consider some frequently used examples of input sanitation.

first: input pattern validation in form. -> Can be bypassed by a simple form post

Second: sanitizing functions. -> better, but has to be implemented for all inputs

third: restricting the types of input -> tied to a specific form - other ways of inputing the same data?

But the type restrictions can be made stronger!

Practical example:

# Handling input data from URL

https:\//tubes.com/report?projectid=<span v-mark.underline.orange>c9b1e9b2-3f5d-4b1e-8b1e-9b2c9b1e9b2c</span>&pipeid=c9b1e9b2-3f5d-4b1e-8b1e-9b2c9b1e9b2c


<div v-click>
```ts
export const getPipeReport = async (pipeId: string, projectId: string): Promise<any> => {
    
    const response = await axios.get(`/api/pipes/${projectId}/report?pipeId=${pipeId}`);
    const data = response.data;
    return data;
};
```
</div>

<div v-click>

`guid`s are often used as lookup keys and some times used unsanitized in an SQL query!

What could go wrong?

</div>

<!--
Consider a frontend url for rendering a report of a pipe of some sort.

[click]
Recognize the query string parameters projectId and pipeId. Typically represented as strings.

[click]
Translates to something like this backend call

[click]
Without security i mind - this could open up for:

- sql injection
- access to wrong project?
- parameter list
by alter projectId

<!--

Using the parameters and passing it on to the api for fetching data. No type checking opens up for run-time errors and possibly invalid input 

[click] Specifying primary type will to some extent ensure we are handling a string and not an array, object or any other type of data.

- ✅ Explicit typing prevents unintended values.
- ✅ Catches potential runtime errors at compile-time.
- ✅ Ensures projectId always behaves like a string.

[click] Defining Guid as a string means exactly that. They are treated the same. 
No extra typechecking and no added safet althoug readability is improved as we can understand a Guid is expected.

[click]
Adding typechecking helps us make sure string and Guid is not interchanged. They are not treated the same.

This way we ensure that if getFromUrl() returns a string, we will have a compile-time error. 

[click]
Solution then is often just doing an explisit cast, and getFromUrl() can return a strng again.

Any validation of the type has to be done manually

[click]
Solution is defining a class

Defining a class makes:
- Even stronger typechecking
- variable immutable
- open up for additional validations

Adding a validation ensures that truly is Guid and adheres to the format requirements of a guid.

For even better encapsulation, define an explisit create method and keep the constructor protected

# Domain Primitive

##  ... a value object so strict in its definition that, if it exists, it'll also be valid. If its not valid, it can't exist.

- Secure by Design, page 253

<!--
So we have arrived at something called a Domain Primitive

-->

---

# Why Domain Primitives?

Strong type-checking
Automated perimeter defence
central, domain relevant input validation

- When ever you create a varible, it is automatically validated and sanitized

---

# How to use Domain Primitives

## Form validaton

```
fomrm_validation() 
{

}
```

### external api santaton

```

const val = red_api(param: Guid) {
  return Pipe.create(axios.get(url))

}
```

# Lessons learned

- Difficult to introduce in legacy applicatons
- Remember to handle exceptions in a proper way
- Keep it tidy and actively use component testing of your Domain Primtives (preferably TDD)
